## 🚀 About

This repository contains the source code for a chess analysis project — a static website where users can view and interact with a chessboard.  
It includes:

- Responsive **HTML/CSS** interface  
- JavaScript-powered board interactions  
- Placeholder space for integrating chess engines for analysis  

This project is a foundation for building more advanced analysis features, training tools, and game review functions.
